    "# Tools - Atomic Agentic's Foundational Functional Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "Atomic Agentic offers a means to build composable, complex agentic systems using classes specifically built on Gang-of-Four design pattern principles. The center of which revolves a term you may be already somewhat familiar with: **Tools**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mainstream concept of a tool overlaps with and is often interchangeable with *methods* and *functions*, but has garnered more association with the two year surge of agentic AI (late 2023 to 2025). Though similar, I propose the following definition for tools in the context of agentic AI and the Atomic-Agentic framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A **Tool** is an *adapter-type interface* for LLM's and humans that provides:\n",
    "> 1. A pointer to a callable object or method\n",
    "> 2. A natural language representation of the method's name, parameter-informed signature, and usage/purpose description.\n",
    "\n",
    "Atomic Agentic provides the `Tool` class, which is designed to offer the added benefit of **a single, schemda-driven, dictionary-based** contract by which a tool can pass inputs to and return the output of its method pointer.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **All tools are invoked using a single dictionary of inputs.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you’ll learn in this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you should be comfortable with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Wrapping a normal Python function as a `Tool`\n",
    "- Calling that Tool using `.invoke({...})`\n",
    "- Understanding *why* dict-first invocation is valuable\n",
    "- Inspecting a Tool’s internal “call plan”\n",
    "- Understanding where Tool metadata comes from\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will **only focus on tools created from local python methods**, but we will cover how we've adapted the standard tool template to handle other types of method-handlers, such as MCP, Agents, and A2A."
